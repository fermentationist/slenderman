# *slenderman*

**slenderman** is a fast and easy way to create a basic [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev) app. With a single command, you will have a running app, that you can then take apart and reassemble as you wish.

The app is set up to use [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/), with [**svelte-loader**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-loader), to compile your code. [**Webpack-dev-server**](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webpack-dev-server) will start up automatically to serve your app, and watch your files for changes (hot reloading!).

## Installation and usage
**slenderman** may be installed globally or locally, and then called from the command line when you wish to create a new Svelte application.

Install globally with **npm**:
```bash
npm install -g slenderman
```
Then call **slenderman** with your app's name as an argument:
```bash
slenderman exampleApp
```
Or, you may allow the use the default directory name, *svelteApp* and just type:
```bash
slenderman
```
*Alternately, you may run **slenderman** without installing it by using `npx`
```bash
npx slenderman exampleApp
```

## What it does

There is nothing fancy going on here; **slenderman** merely executes some bash scripts synchronously:

- `mkdir APPNAME`
This creates a new directory, with the name chosen by the user at runtime, or else, the default name *svelteApp*. If a directory with that name already exists, the program exits with an error.

- `npx degit fermentationist/slender-template`
This command uses [**degit**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit) to clone the  [template repository](https://github.com/fermentationist/slender-template) locally, creating the app.

- `git init`
The directory is initialized as a Git repository.

- `npm init -y`
npm is installed and a package.json manifest file is created.

- `npm install`
The app's dependencies are installed.

- `npm start`
This script will initiate a Webpack build, start up the development server, and launch http://localhost:9000 in the default browser.

Once this short script has executed, you will have a running Svelte app!
